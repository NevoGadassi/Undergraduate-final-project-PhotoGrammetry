# PhotoGrammetry - Undergraduate Final Project

This repository contains the code and resources for the undergraduate final project on photogrammetry. Photogrammetry is the science of making measurements from photographs, especially for recovering the exact positions of surface points.

## Project Overview

The project focuses on using photogrammetry techniques to create 3D models from 2D images. The main components of the project include:

- **CloudCompare**: Used for point cloud processing and visualization.
- **BoofCV**: A computer vision library used for image processing and photogrammetry.
- **Python Scripts**: Custom scripts for automating and enhancing the photogrammetry workflow.

## Repository Structure

- `CloudCompare_v2.13.1_bin_x64/`: Contains the CloudCompare software binaries.
- `boofcv/`: Contains the BoofCV library and related files.
- `clouds_finalpart/`: Contains the final part of the project related to point clouds.
- `boofcv1/`: Contains additional BoofCV resources.
- `Project_book.pdf`: Documentation and detailed report of the project.
- `photogrammetry.py`: Python script for the photogrammetry process.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- CloudCompare v2.13.1
- BoofCV library

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/NevoGadassi/Undergraduate-final-project-PhotoGrammetry.git
2. Install the required Python packages:
   ```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
## Usage
1.Run the photogrammetry script:
   ```sh
python photogrammetry.py
2.Follow the instructions in the script to process your images and generate 3D models.
